Sheboygan to Fond du Lac Railroad
Many years ago railroad tracks used to run from Sheboygan to Fond du Lac.  I've always been interested in this and have never been able to find out a lot of information about the path it took online.
 
From what I can find out the line was completed in 1869 and ran until 1952.
 
I took a little time to create a KML file that can be used as a google earth overlay with what I think the route was.  Most of the tracks were pulled up and land was returned private ownership so my information on the route is based a little bit of knowledge and looking at Google Maps and following tree lines and land anomalies.  Some areas are a little more accurate than others.
